Data Analysis Project
In this project I analyzed 2016 British Colombia housing data to answer few questions. I also used matplotlib to visualize the data and put it on screen for more comprehensive understanding.
 
 Tasks to complete are following:

1. Find out the Community Health Service Areas (chsa) where more than 50% of renters spend 30% or more of their monthly income on rent. Considering these areas’ household income and rent prices, are the rental subsidization rates of these areas appropriate?
2. Examine the data at the “regional” level of Provincial Health Authority (pha): Fraser, Interior, Northern, Vancouver Coastal, and Vancouver Island. Determine whether or not shelter subsidization rates differ across the five pha regions.

 Solutions:

1. In chsa_50plus_rate.png we can see Community Health Service Areas where more than 50% of renters spend 30% or more of their monthly income on rent. I visualized percentages of median monthly incomes spent on rent in those same areas in the file chsa_50plus_income_rent_ratio.png. Also in the file chsa_50plus_subsidy_rates.png, we can see subsidy rates in those areas. First thing we notice is that, despite the residents of University of British Columbia area spending more than 80% of their monthly income on rent, they receive less subsidy rate than those who spend a lot less of their monthly income on rent.Same goes to Richmond City Centre, Shaughnessy-Arbutus Ridge-Kerrisdale, Sunshine Coast Rural and North Vancouver DM-West. Another noticeable thing is, residents of Downtown Eastside receive disproportionately high subsidy rate when compared to others. These findings leads us to councluion that the rental subsidization rates of these areas are not appropriate.

2. Shelter subsidization rates across five PHA regions displayed in the pha_subsidy_rates.png file. In the file pha_income_rent_ratio.png we can see percentages of median monthly income spent on rent in these five regions. Overall, subsidy rates in these regions are proportional to monthly income spent on rent ratio, the only noticeable difference is that Interior receives more subsidy rate than Fraser despite Fraser spending more of their monthly income on rent.
